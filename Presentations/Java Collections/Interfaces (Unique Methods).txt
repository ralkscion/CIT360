List Interface:
- set()
- sort()

Set Interface:
- Can't add duplicate elements. If you try, it will only add it once.

Queue Interface:
- Has a few unique methods of insertion, removal, and inspection (offer, poll, peek).
- offer() returns "false" if it fails to insert an element.
- poll() attempts to remove the head (first element) of the queue. Returns null if ran on an empty queue, while remove() returns false.
- peek() returns but does not remove the head (first element) of the queue.
- Elements are inserted in a FIFO (first in first out) order, starting at the tail.

Map Interface:
- put() method to add elements.
- Has two items per element (key & value)

Tree (Implementation, not an Interface):
- Inserts elements in ascending key order regardless of the order in which you attempt to insert them.
