/*
 * This is a simple multithreading program that demonstrates the creation of two threads, via two different methods.
 * The thread Evens subclasses the Thread class.
 * The thread Odds is an implementation of Runnable, and is executed with an executor (SimpleExecutor).
 * With one executed immediately before the other, via a call to start(), and the second executed with an executor immediately after,
 * the two threads run concurrently. One displays only even numbers, one displays only odd numbers.
 * 
 * If this program is working as intended, the console will display both even and odd numbers, counting up to 100 for each.
 * It should look like a seamless counting effort from 1-100, with no numbers skipped. Granted, they may sometimes display in an imperfect order.
